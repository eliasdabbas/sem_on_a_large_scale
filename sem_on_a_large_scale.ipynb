    "Starting and maintaining SEM accoutns can, and usually is, a daunting task. In addition to hitting your business goals (revenue, conversions, clicks, etc.), you also need to have a systematic structure that is easy to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I will be laying out here is  briefly my thoughts on how to structure an account, but in much more detail, techniques that can help build a large account with numerous products, in a flexible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start by sharing what I think are the most important elements of any SEM account, and how I think they can best be mapped. This is not an explanation of what these elements are, as I'm sure you know, but it is to make explicit my assumptions and views, so it is clear why I am doing what I am doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords >> Ads >> Landing Pages \n",
    "\n",
    "The main process of using search engines hasn't changed much: you go to the search engine's page, type in some words (or increasingly say them these days), get a few results, select one, and click to go to your page of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, the three most important elements that form the bulk of how an account is built are the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keywords: Representing the intention of the user, and what they want. \n",
    "2. Ads: Your promise to the user to satisfy their need, \"I hear you, I have what you want, this is how I can help you, please visit this page.\"\n",
    "3. Landing pages: This is where you satisfy the promise that you made to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you properly map keywords to ads, and send users to the right landing pages, you have achieved the major part of setting up your campaigns. There are many other important things like ad extensions, bidding, and campaign settings for example. It's not that they are any less important, they just don't require that much time to create or set up.   \n",
    "This is also congruent with the main elements that determine quality score; expected CTR, ad relevance, and landing page experience.  \n",
    "To be practically specific, the biggest part of setting up your campaigns is creating two tables, one for the keywords, and the other for the ads. This is what we will be doing, and will end up producing those two tables for a fictional account. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the programming language Python with a few functions that I have developed.  \n",
    "I encourage you to follow along on the [interactive version of this article](https://change-me.com), where you can make modifications to the code and see how that changes the results. Most of the coding that I will share is quite simple, and you should be able to play with it, even if you have no prior programming knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me try and deconstruct the process of keyword research, and how we come up with our final list of keywords.  \n",
    "You first go to a keyword tool. You enter a few keywords that are clearly relevant to the product/service you are promoting. Then the tool gives you a few hundred similar keywords. After that, you go through them one by one, selecting the ones that you believe would be relevant.  \n",
    "Once you are done with selecting the keywords, you export, format, and finally upload them.  \n",
    "You then repeat the process for every product/service that you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have a used cars website for our example, and try to create the campaigns. \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to focus a bit on the process that goes through our minds while selecting our keywords from the keyword tool. Let's start with the product \"Honda\", so we would enter something like \"buy honda\", \"honda price\", \"honda for sale\", and get the tool's suggestions.  \n",
    "While considering the relevant keywords, there are two conditions that a keyword needs to satisfy for it to qualify as relevant: \n",
    "1. **Product:** It has to contain the product, \"honda\" in our case (or any synonym)\n",
    "2. **Word:** It has to contain a verb or word that indicates an intention that I'm trying to satisfy (buying a used Honda in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you think of the possible verbs/words that can express that intention, you will find that they are not that many. Let's brainstorm some: \n",
    "\n",
    "buy, price, shop, used, second hand, auto loan, car loan, auto finance, car finance, cheap, cheapest, best price, lease, leasing, certified.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure you can think of others but the idea is that although there are an infinite number of combinations of words or variations, the words themselves are not that many. Of course using phrase match and modified broad match is crucial in allowing users to come up with combinations that we didn't think of. The important thing here is that we are protected from irrelevant keywords by making sure that the proper verb is there, together with the product name. Needless to say, the proper negative match keywords need to also be added, as an additional layer of relevancy/protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, let's manually construct our first ad group, using just the first three words as a demonstration.  \n",
    "The way I do it is to simply concatenate \"honda\" with each of the words, once before and once after: \n",
    "\n",
    "buy honda  \n",
    "honda buy  \n",
    "price honda  \n",
    "honda price  \n",
    "used honda  \n",
    "honda used  \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, and with phrase match, you can be confident that you cover the majority of keywords that could contain \"honda\" with any of those three words. \"buy honda in <location>\", \"best site to buy honda\", etc. would all be covered. The corner case, is when someone has a word between the word and product. \"buy 2015 model honda\" for example. This can be covered by modified broad match.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we are happy with the word list that we produced, now it is trivial to do what we did with the first three across the board. \"word honda\" and \"honda word\" for all the words that we came up with, and using three match types; exact, phrase, and modified broad.  \n",
    "I'm sure you can now see how trivial it is to do the same for \"honda accord\", \"honda civic\", \"toyota\", \"toyota corolla\" and all the cars that you have on your website.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result our job now, in coming up with our keywords consists of two steps: \n",
    "1. Get the product list together with their corresponding URLs: this is trivial, and your colleague or client can easily send you a list of all the products that they sell, with their landing pages.\n",
    "2. Come up with a list of verbs/words that signal the intention we are trying to satisfy.  "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Step two here is the critical one. You can still use your favorite keyword tool to come up with those words. You can actually do the exercise for several car makes or models, and brainstorm, until you are comfortable that your list of verbs/words is comprehensive enough, then you are basically done. Now we start coding to get the final result.  \n",
    "The challenge now is to do this for a large number of products, and put the keywords in the proper format, the table that contains the campaign name, ad group name, keyword, and match type so we can upload it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In `advertools` ([a Python package for online marketing](https://github.com/eliasdabbas/advertools/)) the `kw_generate` function is the one we will use for this task.  Here are the main arguments that the function takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `products`: Self-explanatory. In our used cars example, that would be 'honda', 'honda accord', 'toyota', etc.\n",
    "* `words`: The verbs/words that we finalized.\n",
    "* `match_types`: A list of up to four possible match types; Exact, Phrase, Modified, or Broad.\n",
    "* `order_matters`: True or False. Whether or not the order of the words in the keyword matters. If True, then you will have \"honda price\" as well as \"price honda\", otherwise, you will only have \"honda price\". \n",
    "* `max_len`: The number of words in a keyword that you want. If you specify 3, for example, the function will combine honda with one word, as well as with two words so you end up with keywords consisting of two and three words. \"honda buy\", \"honda price\", as well as \"honda buy price\", \"honda price buy\", and so on. This preempts the different combinations that will eventually come up, and makes your coverage better. It also exponentially adds to the number of keywords you are generating. More than three is possible, but it becomes way too complicated and cumbersome to be useful. With two and three words per keyword, I think you should be getting very good coverage. \n",
    "* `campaign_name`: Whatever you want to name your campaign. The default is 'SEM_Campaign'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how it works with one product and two words:\n"

It wouldn't hurt to have those keywords in your account, and it is easy to remove them, especially that now we have labels.

    "### Limitations and Possible Issues: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple match types in one ad group:** I never understood why this is a bad thing, and I usually put different match types in the same ad group, because it's more manageable and streamlined. If you prefer that approach, you can simply concatenate the ad group name with the match type, and end up with 'Toyota - Phrase' and 'Toyota - Exact'. This will create those new ad groups for you. You just need to make sure your change is consistent with the ads table.  \n",
    "2. **All in one campaign:** You might also prefer to have more control over budgets and targeting, and may want to put each product in its own campaign (which I think is a good idea). This is very easy, as all you have to do is duplicate the ad group column, and this will create them as campaigns. Combined with the previous step, you can end up with a campaign for Toyota, and ad groups for each of the match types that you are using, if you prefer this kind of structure. Just make sure your changes are consistent with the ads table, if you want to make any of these two campaign structure changes.\n",
    "3. **Synonyms and spelling variations:** There is no straightforward solution to this one. If you have a travel campaign for example, all of the following product names might be used to indicate the same destination: London, LHR, LGW, LDN, UK, England. Or maybe you have a real estate site: 2 bedroom, two bedroom, 2br, 2bed might all be used for the same prupose. In some cases like travel, it might be easier to come up with state, city, country, and airport codes to get synonyms, and in some cases you will have to be creative. \n",
    "4. **Brand and sub-brand issues:** In our example we used 'toyota camry' and 'ford mustang' for example. But why not just use 'camry' as a word, and add the keyword 'buy camry'? The problem is with model names like Dodge Charger for instance. If you have a keyowrd 'buy charger' and not 'buy dodge charger', your budget is going to be vanishing sooner than you want, and you will even be penalized for being irrelevant. A possible solution might be to do include the model without the make only for the names that are clearly referring to the car model and not something else. \n",
    "5. **Generic word products:** In some cases like movie titles, it's not enough to have the movie name on its own. One of the movies released a few years ago was titled \"Sing\", so the keywords 'watch sing' or 'download sing' won't mean much. So in these types of keywords you would need to add a qualifier like 'the film' or 'the movie', to make it clear what you are targeting. \n",
    "6. **Negatives:** This is not an issue actually, and it is very easy to generate, especially that we have a set of uniform and consistent ad groups. For used cars it would be \"new\", \"2019\", \"2020\", \"brand new\", etc. In some cases, you will probably need to add specific negatives at the ad group level. For example there is London, UK, and London, Ontario in Canada. You would need to add -canada as a negative keyword if you are targeting the UK London and vice versa.  \n",
    "6. **Other issues:** There must be some issues that I haven't thought of, and I'm hoping that you share them if you disagree with the approach, or if you have suggestions as to what might go wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the discussion on keywords, since getting product names and their URLs is trivial in most cases, your job boils down to creating a few words to combine them with. I'm sure if asked to come up with twenty words for learning courses, or booking a hotel, or buying a certain product, that you can easily do it in a few minutes. The discussion is now about those 20 - 30 words that make sense for you, and then you are basically done.  \n",
    ">  ### With this approach, you are making a transition from keyword research to keyword \"manufacturing\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's manufacture some ads. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Ads\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to discuss two main techniques for creating ads on a large scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructing ads (bottom up approach): Nothing really different or new here, and can mostly be done with any spreadsheet software. There are some minor benefits though. \n",
    "2. Splitting text to get ads (top-down approach): This approach capitalizes on text that might be on landing pages, and provides a technique for creating ads from that text. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing Ads (bottom-up approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple way of creating ads. Creating each of the slots one by one, and grouping them into one table.  \n",
    "The function `ad_create` automates this by allowing you to provide the following parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `template`: This is the text of the part ad slot you are creating. It could be a header, or a description line. Produt names will dynamically be inserted into their proper position that you specify. For example, you can write \"Get the latest {}\", and the product name will go in the empty space within the curly braces. \n",
    "- `replacements`: A list of the products that you are selling. As a result you will get \"Buy Used Honda\", \"Buy Used Toyota\", \"Buy Used BMW\", and so on. \n",
    "- `fallback`: In case your product name is too long and won't fit in the maximum number of characters allowed, this should replace the long product name with a suitable generic word that might make sense. \n",
    "- `max_len`: The maximum number of characters allowed for that slot of the ad. This makes sure that the text together with replacement (or fallback) don't exceed a certain number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done for any ad slot where you want to insert a product name, and the other can be written normally. For example, we will use this function for Headline 1 and Description 1. The others would be normal static text.  \n",
    "Let's see how it words for one ad slot\n"

This is a totally different subject, and extremely important, but I'm mainly focusing here on techniques that enable us to build ads on a large scale.

The more important thing to make sure we got right, is to make sure that all ad groups in the keywords table exist in the ads table, and vice versa.

    "The issue is how to utilize this text, when you have hundreds of descriptions like this. The challenge is to split this text insto slots, each with a speified maximum number of characters, and making sure that they are meaningful words. You don't want to have an ad \"that has wo | rds that are split like this\".  \n",
    "We will use the `ad_from_string` function to achieve this.  \n",
    "The function takes the following parameters: \n",
    "- `s` (string): Any sentenct/phrase that you want to split. \n",
    "- `slots`: A list of numbers with the maximum allowed characters for each ad slot. The default uses Google's text ad default (30, 30, 30, 90, 90, 15, 15), but you can change it any way you want. \n",
    "- `sep`: The separator with which to split words. Typically, you don't need to change this as text will be split by white space. Sometimes, you might have words separated by underscores or dashes. \n",
